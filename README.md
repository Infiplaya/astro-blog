## Personal website with astro
I rebuilt my old personal website because I had heard a lot of good things about Astro and was not disappointed. Developer experience with astro is really amazing. I think that from now on when building static sites, I will opt for Astro. My portfolio is now faster and weighs less. The website design is inspired by Lee Robinson, Kent C. Dodds and other talented developers.

## Walkthrough
The goal of this project is quite simple. To build a site that would be my own piece of the internet. On the homepage, you can see the navbar, a short description about me, links to selected projects and blog posts.

In the projects tab, as the name suggests, there are blocks that are links to projects on my github.

Next is the blog, where posts will appear from time to time (I also hope to expand, the ones that are already there). The implementation of MDX for blogging with Astro is trivial. I strongly encourage you to read the Astro documentation, if you know HTML, CSS AND JS (and even if you don't) it doesn't take long to grasp this framework. 
Lastly in About there is a description of who I am. I plan to expand it when I find some time.
