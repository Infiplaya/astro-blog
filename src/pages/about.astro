      Iâ€™m PaweÅ‚, a passionate programmer who wants to learn as much as I can
      about web development and build cool apps! Besides programming, I enjoy
      reading books, listening to my favorite music and meeting with my friends.

      I've rebuild my old personal website because I have heard many good things about astro, and it's true.
      This website is inspired by Lee Robinson, Kent C. Dodds and many others.
