This is probably the most advanced thing I made so far. I use all things that T3 stack has to offer. This app is bascially CoinMarketCap style, you have homepage where you can see a list of 100 most popular cryptos, you can click on their name to see a page of specific one. You can sign in (Next Auth) and add the ones you like to the watchlist (I'm using Prisma and TRPC for that). It's still not ready 100% because I'm searching for new ideas and ways to implement them. Basically I'm learning this stuff while doing it.
