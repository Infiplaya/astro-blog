As a developer, it's important to constantly strive to improve your skills and knowledge. That's why I decided to build a quiz app using React. My goal was to play around with states and improve my understanding of interactivity in React.

The quiz app is available for anyone to try, and it covers a variety of topics. However, I found that the questions were quite difficult, so I set the difficulty to easy. Despite the challenges I faced, I learned a lot from building this app.

The app is simple to use. You start the quiz, answer the questions (you only have one chance to guess the answer, after that the question will be locked), and after taking the quiz, you will get automatically scrolled to the top and your results will be displayed.

I initially thought of rebuilding this project, but currently, I donâ€™t have time for it. But maybe in the future, I'll give it a try.

Overall, building this quiz app was a valuable learning experience. I was able to improve my understanding of interactivity in React and become more comfortable with states. I still feel a little rusty in this topic, but I know that with practice and more interactive projects, I will be able to improve my skills even more.

I encourage you to try the quiz and see if you can get all the questions right!
